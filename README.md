üßê The IIEP-UNESCO Moodle platform hosts global capacity development and training activities on educational planning, where as part of the proposed coursework, discussion forums are often used to allow participants to share insights on policy and legislation, and experiences and good practices related to their national contexts. This information is extremely helpful for their learning but also for IIEP, as it also contributes to the Institute‚Äôs research and technical cooperation work.

üéØ¬†Having a Moodle plugin (or suitable external tool) that enables the extraction of data and insights generated through exchanges in IIEP‚Äôs Moodle discussion forums could therefore boost the way IIEP supports countries. Concretely, the challenge is to find a technical solution that organizes insights in a structured manner, helps identify and visualize key terms and concepts, and possibly even generates discussion summaries in different formats.

‚õë¬†If you have skills in either Natural Language Processing, Data visualization, Web Development, Data Engineering or Learning Management Systems ‚Äì Moodle, in particular ‚Äì your participation will be most valued (and if you are part of the Moodle developer community, even better!). You should also be aware that the discussion forums data provided will be in English.

## Excel Export of Moodle forum data

We have also used Moodle‚Äôs Forum Export function to generate the Excel file `Exported Moodle forum data` containing all the discussions in the above forums.

## Excel Export of Aurion participant data

For some challenge tasks, we think you will need some ‚Äúprofile data‚Äù on course participants. Moodle‚Äôs profile data is not very reliable, so although this is a bit artificial, we are providing some profile data from our Aurion admissions system, which includes info on participants countries, jobs, etc. You can find it in `Course participant data - Aurion`.

## Challenge ‚Äúwish list‚Äù from the IIEP team

The `Hackathon Challenge 5 summary wish list` is a short document with some ideas and ‚Äúwishes‚Äù from the IIEP team who proposed this challenge.

## Disability-Inclusive Education Framework

The concepts or terminology or themes that some of the analysis of forum discussions should target are largely contained in the framework graphic found in `Framework 2020`.

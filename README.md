🧐 Learning Management Systems (LMS) contain an important volume of rich and useful information generated through exchanges between learners and instructors in discussion forums. However, this information generally remains unexploited due to the absence of an IT solution to easily extract and analyse it.

🎯 This challenge consists of designing a Moodle plugin (or suitable external tool) that enables users to extract data and insights from discussion forums in a structured manner, identify and visualize key terms and concepts and possibly generate summaries in different formats.

⛑ Experts joining this challenge should have skills in either Natural Language Processing, Datavisualization, Web Development, Data Engineering or Learning Management Systems, in particular Moodle. Participants should be aware that the discussion forums data will be in that language.
